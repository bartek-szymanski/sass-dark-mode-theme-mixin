# Light & Dark Mode Theming for Legacy Projects with Sass Mixins âœ¨

Designed specifically for projects not originally built with **dark mode** in mind, these Sass mixins provide a lightweight and efficient way to implement this important UX feature.

With these powerful **Sass mixins**, you can seamlessly add **light and dark mode** functionality without major code changes.

It's time to embrace better accessibility, and upgrade your users' experience!

## Sass Mixins

```scss
@mixin cssProperty($property) {
  $property-value: var(--#{$property});

  // Define shortcuts for long properties such as `background-color` and `background-image`.
  @if $property == 'bg-color' {
    background-color: $property-value;
  } @else if $property == 'bg-img' {
    background-image: url($property-value);
  } @else {
    // Set other properties normally.
    #{$property}: $property-value;
  }
}

// Mixin to define theme-specific CSS variables
@mixin theme($properties-list...) {
  // Process the list of property-color pairs.
  $properties: meta.keywords($properties-list);

  @each $property, $colors in $properties {
    // Extract separate colors for light and dark themes.
    $color1: list.nth($colors, 1);
    $color2: list.nth($colors, 2);

    // Define CSS custom property for light theme at root scope.
    @at-root {
      #{$selector.nest(':root .theme--light', &)} {
        @content;
        --#{$property}: #{$color1};
      }
    }

    // Define CSS custom property for dark theme at root scope.
    @at-root {
      #{$selector.nest(':root .theme--dark', &)} {
        @content;
        --#{$property}: #{$color2};
      }
    }

    @include cssProperty($property);
  }
}
```

This Sass dark mode project was originally developed and used within the Kwiziq project, an AI language learning platform. Kwiziq prioritizes accessibility and a user-friendly experience for all, and adding light and dark mode was a natural step in achieving that goal. We believe this project can be beneficial to other projects as well, making them more accessible and adaptable to user preferences.
